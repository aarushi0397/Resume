      <p>At One Mobikwik Systems Pvt Ltd I worked as <strong>Software Engineer trainee</strong>. During my time there I was the part of <strong>S.O.C 2.0</strong> project which was based on <strong>Python programming language</strong>. I created a code in python which would track the list of <strong>negative IPs</strong> hitting the servers and generating an alert on the same. We also represented our project in <strong>Mobikwikathon</strong> event which took place within the company itself. In addition to writing the code also <strong>created</strong> a <strong>dashboard</strong> using <strong>Kibana</strong> to monitor the logs of the system.</p>
